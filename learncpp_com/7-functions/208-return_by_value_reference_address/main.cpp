#include <iostream>

int main(){

  // Returning values from a function to its caller by value, address or reference works almost exactly the same way as passing 
  // arguments to a function does. All the same upsides and downsides for each method are present.
  // However, there is one more added bit of complexity -- because LOCAL VARIABLES in a function go out of scope and are destroyed when the 
  // function returns!

  // RETURN BY VALUE
  // Is the simplest and safest return type to use. When a value is returned by value, a copy of the value is returned to the caller.
  // As with pass by value, you can return by value literals, variables or expressions, which makes return by value very flexible



  return 0;
