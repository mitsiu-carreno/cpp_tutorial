//Ask the user how many students they want to enter. 
//Dynamically allocate an array to hold all of the students. 
//Then prompt the user for each name and grade. 
//Once the user has entered all the names and grade pairs, sort the list by grade (highest first). 
//Then print all the names and grades in sorted order.
