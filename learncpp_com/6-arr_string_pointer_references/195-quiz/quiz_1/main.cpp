 * Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items: 
 * health potions, torches, and arrows. Create an enum to identify the different types of items, 
 * and a fixed array to store the number of each item the player is carrying 
 * (use built-in fixed arrays, not std::array). The player should start with 2 health potions,
 * 5 torches, and 10 arrows. Write a function called countTotalItems() that returns how many 
 * items the player has in total. Have your main() function print the output of countTotalItems().
