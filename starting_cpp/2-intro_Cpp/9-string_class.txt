The C++ string class
Standard C++ provides a special data type for storing and working with strings

Because a char variable can store only one character in its memory location, ANOTHER DATA TYPE IS NEEDED FOR A VARIABLE ABLE TO HOLD AN ENTIRE STRING. 
Although C++ does not have a built-in data type able to do this, standard C++ provides something called the STRING CLASS that allows the programmer to create a string type variable 


USING THE STRING CLASS
The first step in using the string class is to #include the "string" header file
  
  #include <string>

The next step is to define a STRING TYPE variable, called a STRING OBJECT. 
Defining a STRING OBJECT is similar to defining a variable of a primitive type

  string movieTitle;

You can assign a STRING LITERAL to movieTitle with the assignment opeartor

  movieTitle = "Wheels of Fury";

You can use cout to display the value of the movieTitle object

  cout << "My favorite movie is " << movieTitle << endl;


// This program demostrates the string class
#include <iostream>
#incluse <string>   // Required for the string class
using namespace std;

int main(){
  string movieTitle;

  movieTitle = "Wheels of Fury";
  cout << "My favorite movie is " << movieTitle << endl;
  return 0;
}
