Determining the size of a data type

The sizeof operator may be used to determine the size of a data type on any system

One of the problems of portability is the lack of common sizes of data types on all machines. 
A special operator called "sizeof" will report the number of byes of memory used by any data type or variable.

  cout << "The size of an integer is " << sizeof(int);
