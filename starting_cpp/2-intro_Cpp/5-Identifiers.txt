Identifiers
An IDENTIFIER is a programmer-defined name that represents some element of a program. 
Variable names are examples of identifiers, you may choose your own variable names in C++ as long as you do not use any of the C++ KEY WORDS. This KEY WORDS make up the "core" of the language and have specific purposes (All are lowercase)

Legal identifiers
Here are some specific rules that must be followed with all identifiers:
-The first character must be one fo the letters "a" through "z" or "A" through "Z", or an underscore character (_)
-After the first character you may use the letters "a" through "z" or "A" through "Z", the digits 0 through 9, or underscores
-Uppercase and lowercase characters are distinct. This means ItemsOrdered is not the same as itemsordered
