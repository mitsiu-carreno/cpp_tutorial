Floating-point Data Types
Floating-poiot data types are used to define variables that can hold real numbers

Internally, floating-point numbers are stored in a manner similar to SCIENTIFIC NOTATION.
The number 47,281.97 in scientific notation is 4.728197x10^4 (10^4 is equal to 10,000 and 4.728197 x 10,000 is 47,281.97)

The first part of the number, 4.728197 is called the MANTISSA. The MANTISSA is multiplied by a power of ten

Computers typically use E notation to represent floating-point values. In E notation, the number 47,281.97 would be 4.728197E4. The part of the number before the E is the MANTISSA, and the part after the E is the power of 10. When a floating point number is stored in memory, it is stored as the MANTISSA and the power of 10

Decimal Notation    Scientific Notation     E Notation
247.91              2.4791 x10^2            2.4791E2
0.00072             7.2 x10^-4              7.2E-4
2,900,000           2.9 x10^6               2.9E6


In C++ THERE ARE THREE DATA TYPES THAT CAN REPRESENT FLOATING POINT NUMBERS
-float (considered SINGLE PRECISION)
-double (considered DOUBLE PRECISION)
-long double  (intended to be larger than the double)

* The exact size of these data types are dependent on the computer you are using the only guarantees are:
-A double is at least as big as float
-A long double is at least as big as a double
