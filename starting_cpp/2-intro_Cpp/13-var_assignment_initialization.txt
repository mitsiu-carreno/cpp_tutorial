Variable assignments and initialization
An assignmente operation assigns, or copies a value into a variable
When a value is assigned to a variable as part of the variable's definition, it is called an INITIALIZATION

The = symbol is called the ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR. Operators perform operations on data.
The data that OPERATORS work with are called OPERANDS. The assignment operator has two operands

In an assignmente statement, C++ requires the name of the variable receiving the assignment to appear on the left side of the operator. 
In C++ the operand on the left side of the = symbol must be an "lvalue" (It is called an lvalue because it is a value that may appear on the left side of an assignment operator).

An "lvalue" is something that identifies a place in memory whose contents may be changed.

The operand on the right side of the = symbol must be an "rvalue". An rvalue is any expression that has a value. 

The assignment statement takes the value of the rvalue and puts it in the memory location of the object identified by the lvalue.

  // This program shows variable intialization
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main(){
    int month = 2, days = 28; // Initialization

    cout << "Month " << month << " has " << days << " days.\n";
    return 0;
  }

C++ allows you to define several variables and only initialize some of them

  int flightNum = 89, travelTime, departure = 10, distance;
