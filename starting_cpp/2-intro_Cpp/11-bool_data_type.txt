The bool data type
Boolean variables are set to either true or false

Expressions that have a true or false value are called Boolean expressions, named in honor of English mathematician George Boole (1815-1864)

The bool data type allows you to create small integer variables that are suitabe for holding true or false values 

// This program demostrates boolean variables
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  bool boolValue;
  cout << boolValue << endl;  // 1
  boolValue = false;
  cout << boolValue << endl;  // 0

  return 0;
}

As you can see, the value true is represented in memory by the number 1, and false is represented by 0.
