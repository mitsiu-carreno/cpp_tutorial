Chapter 1

Computer programming is both an art and a science

*It is an art because every aspect of a program should be carefully designed 
	-The logic flow of the instructions
	-The mathematical procedures
	-The appearance of the screens
	-The way information is presented to the user
	-The program`s "user-friendliness"
	-Manuals and other forms of written documentation

*There is also a scientific, or engineering side of programming, programs rarely work right the first time they are written
	-A lot of testing
	-Correction
	-Redisign

Both artistic and scientific nature of programming make writting computer software like desiging a car:
Both cars and programs should be functional, efficient, powerful, easy to use and pleasing to look at.
