Chapter 1

Computer programming is both an art and a science

*It is an art because every aspect of a program should be carefully designed 
	-The logic flow of the instructions
	-The mathematical procedures
	-The appearance of the screens
	-The way information is presented to the user
	-The program`s "user-friendliness"
	-Manuals and other forms of written documentation

*There is also a scientific, or engineering side of programming, programs rarely work right the first time they are written
	-A lot of testing
	-Correction
	-Redisign

Both artistic and scientific nature of programming make writting computer software like desiging a car:
Both cars and programs should be functional, efficient, powerful, easy to use and pleasing to look at.

Hardware - Refers to the physical components that a computer is made of.
	-The central processing unit (CPU)
	-Main memory
	-Second storage devices
	-Input devices
	-Output devices

	*CPU
		In the earliest computers, CPU's were huge devices made of electrical and mechanical components such as vacuum tubes and switches. Today CPU's are small chips known as microprocessors.
		The CPU's job is to fetch instrucctions, follow the instructions, and produce some result. 
		Internally the central processing unit consists of two parts.
			-Control Unit
			-Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)
			
			*Control Unit
				Coordinates all the computer operations. It's responsible for determining where to get the next instruction and regulating the other major components of the computer with control signals. 
			*Arithmetic and logic unit
				Is designed to perform mathematical operations.

		A program is a sequence of instrucctions stored in the computer's memory. When a computer is running a program, the CPU is engaged in a process known formally as the "fetch/decode/execute cycle" 
			-Fetch: The CPU's control unit fetches, from main memory, the next instruction in the secuence of program instructions
			-Decode: The instruction is encoded in the form of a number. The control unit decodes the instruction and generates an electronic signal
			-Execute: The signal is routed to the appropiate component of the computer (such as the ALU, a disk drive, or some other device). The signal causes the component to perform an operation.

	*Main memory
		Is the computer's work area. This is where the computer stores a program while the program is running, as well as the data that the program is working with.
		Main memory is commonly known as "random-access memory" or RAM. The CPU is able to quickly access data stored at any random location in RAM. 
		RAM is usually a "volatile" type of memory that is used only for temporary storage while a program is running.
		A computer's memory is divided into tiny storage locations known as bytes. One byte is enough memory to store only a letter of the alphabet or a small number. In order to do anything meaninful, a computer must have lots of bytes.
