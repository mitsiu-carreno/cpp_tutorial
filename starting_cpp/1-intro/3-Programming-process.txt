The programming process
Designing and creating a program

  These are the steps recommended for the process of writing a program
  1. Clearly define what the program is to do.
  2. Visualize the program running on the computer
  3. Use design tools such as a hierarchy chart, flowcharts, or pseudocode to create a model of the program
  4. Check the model for logical errors
  5. Type the code, save it and compile it
  6. Correct any errors found during compilation. Repeat 5 and 6 as many times as necessary
  7. Run the program with test data for input
  8. Correct any errors found while running the program, repeat 5 - 8 as many times as necessary
  9. Validate the results of the program
