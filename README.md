## Compiling
```cpp
$ g++ -std=c++1z -o main -I headers/ src/* 
```
* g++ GCC, normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking
* -std=c++1z determines the language standard (C++17 from 2017)
* -o place output in the file main
* -I add the directory headers to the list of directories to be searched for header files
